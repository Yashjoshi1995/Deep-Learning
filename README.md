# Deep-Learning

## ANN:
A dataset was solved using Neural Networks. The accuracy obtained was around 86%.
A comparison was then made with the machine learning algorithms- Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier, Boosting, and it was found that the accuracy was almost same, i.e 86%. So it is not always that accuracy increases by using neural networks. In problems like classification and regression, we can get almost same accuracy without using neural networks.
Neural networks majorly helps to process image data with high accuracy.
